# Location Profile

## The Hostel

**Name:** Alchemist's Rest Hostel
**Type:** Historic / Budget
**Star Rating:** 4
**Price Range:** $22-$40 per night

### History
Built in 1924 as a boarding house, but the building dates to 1598 - originally the laboratory and residence of Johann Kessler, an alchemist under Rudolf II's patronage. Kessler vanished in 1612 during an experiment to "master time itself." The building has been continuously occupied since, changing purpose but always drawing travelers. Converted to hostel in 1995. Guest ledgers from all eras are displayed in the lobby (a "quirky" feature that hides the truth: some names appear multiple times on the same date).

### Architecture
- **Style:** Czech Baroque with Gothic foundation, warren-like interior with odd angles
- **Floors:** 4 (ground + 3 upper) plus cellar
- **Total beds:** 52
- **Notable features:** Original stone cellar (off-limits), courtyard with sundial that sometimes shows the wrong time, unusually high number of clocks (none keep identical time)

### The Death Location (Specific)
**Where exactly does the death occur?**
Various locations across Prague for the many deaths, but the "final" death occurs in the hostel common room. The first death (shower slip) occurs in the second-floor bathroom. The loop seems to emanate from the sealed cellar.

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Petra
**Description:** 24, studies history at Charles University, took the job because she's fascinated by the building, suspects something is wrong but doesn't know what
**Role in death:** Oblivious but occasionally delivers warnings without understanding them

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Dagmar | Oldest staff member, avoids the cellar door, leaves small offerings (salt, iron) at thresholds |
| Security | None | Low crime area, door codes |
| Bar/Kitchen | Tomas | Night bartender, has worked here 10 years, knows guests sometimes have "strange nights" |
| Manager | Jan | All business, dismisses any talk of building's history as marketing |

### Staff Knowledge
Dagmar knows. She's worked here 40 years. She's seen trapped guests before - the ones who seem to repeat conversations, who look at her with the eyes of someone who's seen her a hundred times. She doesn't know how to help them. She just leaves salt and prays.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Lively, social, travelers comparing Prague experiences, planning day trips

### Night Vibe
Bar gets busy, social until late, then quiet. Some nights, certain guests seem to move differently, like they know what's going to happen.

### Guest Demographics
Backpackers on European circuit, stag/hen parties, students, solo travelers, occasional researchers drawn to Rudolf II's alchemy history

### Reputation
"Great location, weird vibes." Reviews consistently mention the "atmospheric" building, some note deja vu feelings. A few reviews mention vivid dreams. One review (marked "not helpful"): "I've been here before. I've never been to Prague before."

## Practical Details

- Prague's architecture and layout should be accurate
- The Astronomical Clock really does have complex moving parts

### Cultural Sensitivity
